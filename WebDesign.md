# Web Design Basics!

## Font Size (`15px - 25px`)

Use a font size between **15-25px** for content!

-   using something smaller would be too small
-   using something larger is annoying

## For Headers? (`60px - 90px`)

Use really big fonts for headlines!

-   60px-90px, whatever looks good!
-   font-weight **MUST** be lighter so the text does not look bulky

## Line Spacing (`120% - 150%`)

Line spacing is the distance between text, having good line spacing will make things easy to read!

-   Line spacing should be around 120%-150%
-   should be used if you have lots of content on website!

## `45 to 90` characters per line!

It will be easier to read and follow!

-   having less will make it look werid
-   having way too much letters, the eyes will have to wonder more and does not make it easier to read!

## Use good fonts

The most important part:

```
sans-serif VS serif
```

`sans-serif`: Tesla

-   neutral
-   clean
-   simple
-   modern websites

`serif`: New York Times

-   story telling
-   newpaper
-   has thoses things called strokes, or serifs
-   long reading

### How to choose font?

Choose a font which reflects the best look for your site!

-   do not use more than one font, if you are, play around to see what is a good pairing!

## Google Web Fonts

Google how to use web fonts that you can include in your project!

# Colors

Use only **`5 base colors`** for a clean look!

Take a look!

These are colors that will be easy too look at and create a color consistent page!

If you want to show importance for your site, choose a popping color!

**NEVER** use black in your desgin.

-   Brighter tones are more energetic and darker shades are more powerful and elegant.

`RED` = passion, strength, powerful, energetic

`ORANGE` = cheerfulness, creativity, not too powerful

`YELLOW` = brightness, powerful

`GREEN` = money, balance & harmonize

`BLUE` = professionalism, trust, honor, peace

`PURPLE` = power, wealth, wisdom, mystery

`PINK` = postivity, care

`BROWN` = relaxation and confidence, comfort

# Images

Image heavy websites are **better** websites!

## `Text` on Photo

### Overlay

Put text on top of pictures, it's a very good way to use photos in your websites!

-   put overlay (`opacity`!) on photos so text can be visible
-   color gradience are nice too! - red to purple - red to orange

**Do not use random colors!**

### Opaque Boxes

Opaque boxes to show text are nice, you can see images **without** having to put an overlay on top of the photo!

## `Blur` the Image

### Blurred Images

Great for depth, you can use text on the blurred part of the image!

## `Floor` Fade

### Using Black to Fade at the Footer

Increases page readability dramatically!

# Icons

It increases aesthetics and determines the look and feel of website. Used carefully!

-   Icons should be recognizable

-   Icons should be labeled

-   Used to showcase features (pluralsite icons for the courses)

-   Used to show actions and links! (gear icon, FB icons, etc.)

-   Icons should **`NOT`** take center stage, they are supporting features

-   `Static` IMG vs `VECTOR` IMG

    -   use vector as it does NOT lose resolution

-   There are tons of webpages that shares free icons!

# Spacing & Layout

## White Space

### Keeps things organized!

Space between content, headings, nav bar

-   makes the page inviting and nice to look at!

-   without white space, congestion is what you're looking at!

-   Put white space everywhere but don't exaggerate!

<br>
<br>

# UI

## User Experience

Overall experience with the app

-   How the app should work, so make it work.
-   Desiging the product VS the experience
    Ketchup Example

    -   having the traditional design VS the cap being on the button!

    Cap on the button is MORE functional and retains beauty!

# Inspirations

## Other sites

### Use them for examples

You do not have to reinvent the wheel, take the leading websites you know and use that as an example!

### See how they are built!

Open the console and **STEAL** like an artist... don't worry about originality yet.
