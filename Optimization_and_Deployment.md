# Optimization

-   Optimize the images because they are usually the bigger files!

## Pictures

-   First, we inspected the size of the photos!

    -   900 x 600
    -   we want it to be only TWICE the size of the current photo (current at 375 x size --> 750 x size)
    -   we will have to change it!

-   The cities are opened with Preview

    -   the size of all photos will now be 750 x 500 pixels
    -   very good FILE REDUCTION. We are optimizing!
    -   it DID increase the quality of the pics.. interesting.

-   The photos for the grid!

    -   from 800 x 600 px --> 330 x 248 px

## Optimizilla!

http://www.optimizilla.com

-   this will compress the pictures!
-   a tool online

-   did it for the HERO PICTURES. Amazing how small it can get without ruining the resolution!
-   changed the pics in `style.css`, now using the `-min` jpegs downlnoaded from optimizilla!

# Minify CSS + JS (jQuery) !!

-   In React there is a bundler, I can just use that bc that is the optimized version!

## Search Engine Optimization -- user should be able to find your site!

SEO, it promotes a website to increate the # of visitors the site recieves from a search engine!

`<meta>` is important!

## meta decription tag!

`<meta name="description" content="Press me!! I am the best site.">`

Also include the content type!

## HTML Validation!

w3c can validate a URI, Uniform Resource Identifier

https://validator.w3.org/

-   Pretty cool, it tells you what you can optimize!

## Content is King

-   Important that your content is KING!
-   Keywords will be NECESSARY, search engines will search for these!
-   Backlinks, other sites that will link to your sites!

# Deployment!

Just three steps!

1. choose and buy domain name!
2. Buy web hosting, a file in the internet where we will put our files!
3. Upload our site!

# Node Modules

This is important, `node_modules` is NOT pushed normally so... i got an error and it was not being downloaded in the Network tab in Chrome Dev Tools!!
