# Front End-Recap and Completed

**First** and **foremost**, don't think about _everything_ yet. Just code what you need. Everything will follow.

-   Create the folders that you will code in, or will need. You don't need to create all the folders yet.

-   Starting to code the food card and a menu to show case the cards

-   Grabbed some photos of the web and created an array of objects ready to map

# Food Card

## Flexbox

-   `flex-flow` = `flex-direction` + `flex-wrap`

-   `flex` = `flex-grow` + `flex-shrink` + `flex-basis` (width)

-   `justify items` + `justify self` NOT for Flexbox, only `justify-content`

-   justify-content, align-items, flex-flow, flex

## Box Shadow

just box shadow makes it look like a card already

## images

should have `width: 100%` and `display: block`

## Flow of work

don't fully polish it, just work on small things at a time!
